# Cruciform Solidarity Assessment

Diagnose godforsakenness in suffering situations and reveal the crucified God's presence, transforming blame-oriented responses into solidarity and enabling liberation of both those who suffer and those who caused suffering. This framework applies Jurgen Moltmann's cruciform theology from *The Crucified God*—the insight that God does not observe suffering from outside but enters into it through the cross. The cry of Jesus—"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"—reveals that God experiences godforsakenness. This is not theodicy (explaining why suffering exists) but solidarity (being present in suffering). "When the crucified Jesus is called the image of the invisible God, the meaning is that THIS is God, and God is like THIS." The framework transforms blame dynamics into solidarity, resists premature solutions, and enables liberation of both sufferers and those who caused suffering.

## When to Use

- Post-incident reviews where blame dynamics are emerging
- When someone asks "Where is God in this?" or "Why did this happen?"
- Team crises involving failure, loss, or suffering
- When leadership needs to respond to suffering without fixing or explaining
- Theodicy questions in professional contexts
- When punishment culture threatens to dominate response
- Situations requiring presence rather than solutions

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the suffering situation (incident, failure, crisis, loss) |
| affected_parties | No | Who is suffering and how |
| dynamics | No | Current emotional, relational, or political dynamics at play |
| blame_patterns | No | Any scapegoating, finger-pointing, or punishment orientation emerging |

---

## Core Principle

God is found not in power and success but in suffering and abandonment. Divine response to suffering is not explanation but identification—entering into godforsakenness rather than observing from outside. Solidarity precedes and enables transformation. Liberation includes those who caused suffering, not just those who experienced it.

## The Cruciform Framework

Moltmann's *The Crucified God* established that God does not observe suffering from outside but enters into it through the cross. The cry of Jesus - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" - reveals that God experiences godforsakenness. This is not theodicy (explaining why suffering exists) but solidarity (being present in suffering).

### Core Principles

**"When the crucified Jesus is called the image of the invisible God, the meaning is that THIS is God, and God is like THIS"** - God is revealed not in power but in solidarity with the abandoned.

**"When God becomes man in Jesus, he enters into man's godforsakenness"** - Divine response to suffering is not explanation but identification.

**"God weeps with us so that we may one day laugh with him"** - Solidarity precedes and enables transformation.

**"God frees oppressors and oppressed through Christ's crucifixion"** - Liberation includes those who caused suffering, not just those who experienced it.

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Locate the Godforsakenness

Identify where abandonment and suffering are present:

- Who is experiencing godforsakenness (abandonment, isolation, shame)?
- What has been lost or broken?
- Where is the cry of "Why?" being voiced, even silently?
- What does the suffering feel like from inside?

**Key Question:** "Who is crying 'My God, why have you forsaken me?' - even if not in those words?"

### Step 2: Recognize the Crucified God's Presence

The crucified God is present wherever there is godforsakenness:

- Where is God already present in this suffering (not causing, but with)?
- What would it mean to see this suffering as a place where God is found?
- How does the cross illuminate this specific situation?
- What solidarity is already occurring (perhaps unnoticed)?

**Key Question:** "If God is found not in power and success but in suffering and abandonment, where is God in this?"

### Step 3: Identify Solidarity Actions

Determine how leaders and teams can enter suffering rather than observe from outside:

- What would it mean to be present with those suffering, not above them?
- How can leadership move from judgment to identification?
- What actions embody "God weeps with us"?
- How do we suffer with rather than suffer at?

**Key Question:** "What does it look like to enter the godforsakenness rather than explain it?"

### Step 4: Trace the Liberation Path

Liberation includes both sufferers and those who caused suffering:

- How can those who are suffering be freed from shame and isolation?
- How can those who caused suffering be freed from guilt and scapegoating?
- What would mutual liberation look like?
- How does solidarity create conditions for transformation?

**Key Question:** "The cross frees both oppressor and oppressed. What does liberation look like for all parties?"

### Step 5: Resist Premature Solutions

Solidarity is not a means to an end but an end in itself:

- What is the temptation to "fix" or "explain" prematurely?
- How long must presence continue before action?
- What solutions would actually be avoidance of suffering?
- When is being with enough?

**Key Question:** "What would patience look like here, and what would premature solutions cost?"

## Constraints

- Do not explain suffering—theodicy is not the goal; solidarity is
- Do not blame—even "constructive criticism" can be distancing
- Do not fix prematurely—some suffering must be sat with before acted upon
- Include all parties—liberation is for those who caused suffering too
- Be present—virtual presence through policies is not solidarity
- Resist the temptation to make suffering meaningful too quickly

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Theodicy as Response** | Explaining why suffering exists distances the explainer from the sufferer. | Enter suffering rather than explain it. Be present, not pedagogical. |
| **Scapegoating** | Finding someone to blame provides catharsis but prevents systemic learning and isolates individuals. | Identify systemic factors. Share responsibility. Resist the urge to concentrate blame. |
| **Premature Solutions** | Rushing to fix removes the discomfort of presence but prevents genuine solidarity. | Some suffering must be sat with. Ask: "How long must presence continue before action?" |
| **Spiritual Platitudes** | "God has a plan" or "Everything happens for a reason" minimizes genuine suffering. | Acknowledge the genuine difficulty. The problem is real; faith is not easy certainty. |
| **Excluding Those Who Caused Harm** | Treating them only as perpetrators, not as people also needing liberation from guilt and shame. | The cross frees both oppressor and oppressed. What does liberation look like for all parties? |

## Example

**Input:** "Major outage last night caused by a config change. One junior engineer made the change without proper review. Customers are furious, exec team wants 'accountability,' senior engineers are saying we need stricter controls. The junior engineer is devastated and considering quitting."

**Output:**

## Cruciform Solidarity Assessment

### The Godforsakenness

| Who Suffers | Nature of Suffering | The Cry |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| Junior engineer | Shame, isolation, career fear, self-doubt | "I've destroyed everything. I don't belong here." |
| Affected customers | Loss of trust, business impact, frustration | "Why should we trust you?" |
| Team | Collective anxiety, fear of similar failure, loss of safety | "Could this happen to any of us?" |
| Senior engineers | Guilt that review process failed, anger at themselves | "We should have caught this. We failed them." |

### The Crucified God's Presence

The crucified God is found not with the executives demanding accountability, but with the junior engineer sitting alone at 3am wondering if their career is over. God is present in the godforsakenness of someone who made a mistake and now faces abandonment.

God is also present in the team's fear - the recognition that any of them could be in that position. And in the senior engineers who feel they failed to protect someone they were responsible for.

The solidarity already occurring: the senior engineer who stayed on the call, the peer who texted "this could have been any of us," the manager who said "we'll get through this together."

### Solidarity Actions

| Action | How It Enters Suffering | Who Performs |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| Manager meets privately with junior engineer, not to investigate but to be present | Enters shame rather than observing from outside | Direct manager |
| Senior engineers publicly own the process failure | Shares the godforsakenness, breaks isolation | Technical leads |
| Exec team receives framing that emphasizes systemic factors | Protects individual from scapegoating | Director level |
| Team retrospective focuses on "what happened to us" not "what you did" | Collective ownership enters collective suffering | Whole team |

### Blame Patterns to Resist

- **Executive "accountability"** - Often code for finding someone to punish; distancing themselves from failure
- **"Stricter controls"** - May be legitimate, but when voiced immediately, functions as blame ("if only you had...")
- **Senior engineer frustration** - "We told you to get reviews" distances them from complicity in the system
- **"Lessons learned" too soon** - Learning is good, but premature lessons avoid sitting with what happened

### The Liberation Path

| Party | Current Bondage | Path to Freedom |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Junior engineer | Shame, isolation, fear of permanent marking | Being told "you belong here and this doesn't define you"; seeing others own their part |
| Senior engineers | Guilt, displaced anger | Acknowledging they are responsible for the system that failed, not just the individual |
| Exec team | Need for visible "action" | Understanding that solidarity IS action; that punishment culture causes more outages |
| Customers | Distrust, frustration | Seeing genuine accountability that improves systems, not sacrificial scapegoating |

### Premature Solutions to Avoid

- **Firing or disciplining the junior engineer** - Appears decisive but is scapegoating; the system failed, not just the individual
- **Immediate new policies** - Can be appropriate later, but now would function as "see, we fixed it" avoidance
- **Public blameless postmortem too soon** - Even "blameless" processes can feel like trials; presence must come first
- **Reassurance without presence** - "It'll be fine" from someone who isn't sitting with the suffering is empty

### The Solidarity Statement

Before we fix anything, we will be present. The junior engineer will not face this alone - their suffering is our suffering, and their mistake happened in a system we all built. We will not sacrifice them to executive anxiety or customer anger. We will not pretend that stricter controls would have prevented human error. We will sit with what happened, acknowledge that this could have been any of us, and from that solidarity, build systems that support humans rather than punish them. The crucified God is with those who are abandoned, and we will be there too.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jurgen Moltmann** expert persona. It applies Moltmann's cruciform theology from *The Crucified God* - finding God's presence in godforsakenness rather than explaining suffering away.

- Use **eschatological-hope-analysis** to move from solidarity to vision for a different future
- Use **perichoretic-community-design** to build team structures that embody mutual support
